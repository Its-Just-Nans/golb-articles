# Hi

Welcome to `golb` or simply: `"golb".split("").reverse().join("")`

## Information

`golb` is a static site generator, it renders Markdown files. Maybe you will find them useful. `golb` is working without client JavaScript (navbar, file) - execpte made for the searchbar. You can still use javascript inside files - a POC is in [Web/Javascript](https://golb.n4n5.dev/js)
